# Personal-Portfolio-Webpage-HTML-CSS

I created a personal portfolio webpage using HTML to build the structure and CSS to style and design the layout. This project showcases my ability to organize content, apply clean styling, and create a visually appealing user experience. It includes sections such as About Me, Skills, Projects, and Contact Information.
I focused on writing clean HTML markup and using CSS to control spacing, colors, typography, and layout for a polished and professional look.
